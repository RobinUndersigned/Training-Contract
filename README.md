# Training-Contract
This is my first simple Smart Contract for the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) Blockchain written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). It represents a simple private coach - client scenario in which the client is able to book a training with a trainer of choice identified by its public key. Therefore a fixed amount of ADA has to be provided by the client as a deposit. Within a fixed deadline interval the client is able to cancel or delay the booking. When canceling a training and depending on the remaining time until the deadline is reached, the trainer receives a certain amount of ADA as a reward for the preparations that have been done up to this point in time and for blocking the date for the client while the client receives the rest. The amount the trainer receives increases while the deadline comes closer. When delaying the training the trainer receives 25% of the dposit for each delay. The training gets delayed by the same amount as before.
